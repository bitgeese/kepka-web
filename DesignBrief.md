# Updated Cursor IDE Style Guide for Jakub Kepka Website

I'll refine the design style with a bolder approach featuring high-contrast elements and a more Y2K/techno-inspired aesthetic.

## Design Philosophy
- **Disruptive Minimalism**: Stark minimalism punctuated by bold, high-contrast elements reminiscent of Y2K techno aesthetics
- **Narrative Tension**: Sharp visual contrasts that reflect Jakub's journey from troubled background to artistic expression
- **Neo-Warsaw Edge**: Contemporary Polish design sensibilities with digital-age techno undertones

## Color Palette
- **Primary**: Pure black (#000000) and stark white (#FFFFFF) as the foundation
- **Accent**: Electric red (#FF0030) - bold, vibrant, techno-inspired red with maximum impact
- **Secondary**: Industrial gray (#363636) - darker, more commanding presence
- **Digital Blue**: (#00FFFF) - used extremely sparingly for critical interactive elements

## Typography
- **Headlines**: Eurostile Extended - bold, technical, with futuristic qualities
- **Body**: Suisse Int'l - precise, modern with technical undertones
- **Accents**: Custom glitch-inspired typography for special moments
- **Hierarchy**: Extreme contrast between oversized headlines and precise body text

## Layout & Whitespace
- **Grid**: Asymmetrical grid with intentional disruptions and high-contrast divisions
- **Whitespace**: Strategic voids (50-60%) to create dramatic framing of content
- **Composition**: Bold, isolated elements with stark separation
- **Alignment**: Predominantly left-aligned with occasional unexpected breaks

## Corners & Shapes
- **Primary Elements**: Razor-sharp corners (0px radius)
- **Interactive Elements**: Either completely sharp or perfectly circular (no in-between)
- **Dynamic Elements**: Occasional diagonal slashes across the layout to create visual tension

## UI Elements
- **Buttons**: Text transforms to solid blocks of electric red on hover
- **Navigation**: Hidden menu that reveals with dramatic glitch animation
- **Image Treatments**: High-saturation imagery with occasional digital distortion effects
- **Hover States**: Bold inversions or color floods rather than subtle transitions

## Motion & Animation
- **Transitions**: Quick, technical animations (300-500ms) reminiscent of digital interfaces
- **Micro-interactions**: Precise, immediate feedback (100ms) with occasional glitch effects
- **Scroll Effects**: Content that snaps rather than flows, creating distinctive sections
- **Loading**: Digital distortion or scan-line effects that reference both technology and textile

## Image Style
- **Photography**: High-contrast, editorially styled with occasional color channel splitting
- **Background**: Digital noise textures alternating with stark emptiness
- **Product Images**: Dramatically lit against pure black or white backgrounds
- **Art Direction**: Bold, confrontational compositions that challenge conventional fashion imagery

## Accessibility Considerations
- Ensure the electric red maintains minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio against backgrounds
- Implement keyboard navigation that maintains the bold aesthetic
- Include distinctive focus states using the electric red
- Provide alternative experiences for users sensitive to high-contrast visuals

This refined style guide embraces a bolder, techno-inspired Y2K aesthetic with high-contrast elements while maintaining the conceptual connection to Jakub Kepka's artistic vision and personal narrative.es
