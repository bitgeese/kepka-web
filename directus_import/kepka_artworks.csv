So once I put one quarter of a mushroom over the canvas I added the scenery that from the painting ""Torment"" I want to continue and just painted it. I felt great satisfaction is painted in the way I aspire in painting. This work has given me a lot of happiness and fulfillment. It is a tribute to nature and its brilliant design. The second painting, on the other hand, is an ongoing fascination with bones as also an ideal building block in nature.

89e3afb4-7f5e-49a5-8228-c3248fa5580c,"""Torment"" 60x70 2023 Oil on wood ","""Torment""
A painting depicting the problems the author is facing, moments when he feels a complete lack of motivation and value. The eyes represent a harsh assessment of the inner self, which mercilessly on the basis of traumas with a cold gaze convinces the author of his weakness. The face, on the other hand, conveys a facial expression intended to convey a sense of humiliation of regret and hopelessness, the grimace is sad and pleading in its attitude to the eyes. The face asks that the self-criticism stop because it leads to disaster and a sense of complete helplessness and hopelessness. The sharp elements symbolize the pain of the situation, and the wall is symbolic of the author's feeling that he has reached a wall that he is unable to pass through, it also symbolizes the fear that a wall has been created through drugs, which will never again allow him to feel his previous joy, satisfaction and motivation. The green color symbolizes space, like fields or gardens, but is reduced to the simplest, uninteresting, drab form, which also highlights this with the author's fear of not being able to see the beauty of nature in a real way. The green element of grass, land, is trimmed down to such simplicity that it resembles not quite generated computer graphics, which also has a very negative connotation in the eyes of the creator.The mustard color at the bottom is a reference to an earlier work with the title ""According to Nolde, yellow means suffering"" here the color of yellow is supposed to be so intense that it goes all the way to dark mustard, which is supposed to emphasize the state of very strong, even unbearable property.
