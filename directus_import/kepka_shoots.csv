fc136715-8acb-4932-af48-118c68872d21,Caregiver/Primabalerina,"Silhouette of a square form dedicated to my mother. I wanted to embrace and talk about how I perceived my mother as a child. My mother always wore large ponchos and denim skirts, often a skirt over pants. She seemed monumental to me, I felt protection and support, hence I created a poncho that is stiff, reminiscent of an armor that gives shelter. I used materials that I got from her a very long time ago, they are materials from my grandmother, my mother's mother. The monumentality and hardness of the silhouette is meant to symbolize my respect for the Mother who protects. The second silhouette is my nostalgia for simple beauty. The silhouette is inspired by ballerinas however in a color scheme close to my taste. It is a nostalgic and romantic capture of simple beauty. The silhouette is meant to symbolize my longing for simple beauty that does not exaggerate, is not provocative, does not give narrative, is in my opinion simply delicate and pretty, despite the use of stiff materials.",2025-02-04T22:30:56.714Z,gowienko

cde86ac8-f24e-4d9c-bf80-64a017a968d6,Prototype,"Introduction to the fashion show series. I wanted to be inspired by the prototypes of things and the idea of surrealist primitivism. I also want to capture in the new collection what appeals to me most in art, which is to capture ""something"" through expression as limited as possible, to capture as much as possible through as few means of expression as possible. This is my personal ideal to which I aspire in painting and clothing design.

d596319c-8a14-478a-b92a-71be6463ef6e,The Village Show,"I was able to do this show with two designers that I know and who have inspired me. One is [Tomasz Armada](https://www.instagram.com/tomaszarmada/), who has been an inspiration to me for a long time and I have great respect for him. The other is my close friend Martyna Konieczny, the creator of [no_przesada](https://www.instagram.com/no_przesada/) brand. The show took place a month after my graduation from fashion design school, after graduation I managed to create 8 new silhouettes for a month and improved the previous 2 from the graduation show.
The whole idea was focused on conveying a message about authenticity and sincerity in art, I wanted to do an event, a fashion show that would be without divisions without commercialism, pure art from the people for the people, these are the values that guide me. I managed to organize models, stylists, people related to fashion as guests and help. Everyone helped non profit, people were happy to take part in such a project. Everything worked out perfectly, better than I imagined, the subject even caught the interest of the press, specifically two big newspapers here from Poland, I was very happy because they understood the overtones of the event and described the show as just a symbol of authenticity and sincerity in art.

The female silhouette represents the artist, who is in a mourning outfit that is black, heavy and made of strong materials, but has white abstract and monumental cuffs that emphasize the unearthly power of the artist's hands, which are the medium for materializing images and visions. The male figure, on the other hand, has an outfit mainly made of a bag
for a corpse, which portrays the figure as ""Art"" itself, which is dead and having a final encounter with the artist. The models are very much cosmic resembling
figures from another planet, a procedure intended to represent a way of thinking about art in which it is such a strong and beautiful power that it cannot be conceived
as an everyday force, a force to be grasped by the human mind or possible to explore, compared here to the cosmos and areal cosmic entities. Burning pyres
in the emptiness of the fields are a reference to funerals in ancient cultures and to the power of fire, here compared to the endless power of art.

I would like to thank everyone who participated in this project, especially the models who were exposed to really harsh weather conditions, and yet
they created a unique atmosphere. I am full of admiration and really thank you.

The title is my thought and inspiration for the collection, in which I lament an issue that is hard for me and tires me. It is the problem of adaptation, of commercialism,
the abandonment of personality at the expense of clicks, lucrative friendships or pure material gain, a problem that in my world leads to the disintegration of us, and to
dying of art. It is a problem that I think affects all of us-sacrifice a set of values at the expense of commercial gain. A situation in which one abandons oneself,
in my opinion the greatest value in artistry, for the sake of results. I ask the question, does creativity make sense then? Is cooperation with a company or a person who acts against our
principles, values, is it worth more reach, money or connections? Does art then have any meaning, or is it a product and a medium where we are not
as creators? In my opinion, the strongest power is us, our experiences, our thoughts, our world, which is why it pains me how easy it is to give that away.

The session ""Sentence"" tells the story of emotions accompanying the waiting for the title event. The silhouettes are the realization of all the feelings that accompany you while waiting for the day of the orchard and, for example, the male silhouette, which represents the phenomenon of decay through fear. The creation is reconstructed, the form breaks down, the orange material is compressed compressed which I also associate with the phenomenon of personality disintegration through fear. The psyche is ""compressed and squeezed"" to make room for the fear of the unknown. Fear is presented in a grotesque way through the makeup and hair of the model. Heavy boots refer to the portable term ""sticking to the ground"", they outline here the role of our defense against the phenomenon, we try to keep our mental health and peace, but waiting for the ""Judgment"" takes it away from us. The silhouette (black, with a cap) creeps the hands of the model, wraps it in the darkness of color, it is a symbol of our helplessness, surrender. The model's face is pale, as if life has escaped from her, the rubber bands glued on pretend to be a fleeing color, which seems to peel off the pale face. The silhouette with the short pants, similar to the boxing pants, represents the desire to fight, the model has gloves (made of cigarettes), which also resembles the gloves for fighting. The model also has armor on her chest, which also shows the desire to fight, to defend against the situation. The last creation in a heavy hat with a big heavy top shows us the gravity of the situation, which presses, encloses, absorbs us. White tights, a white face, white gloves, are supposed to convey the fact that the character disappears, gives in to the pressure of the gravity of the situation. The whole composed against the background of plastic blue bags. Blue in such a shade annoys me, evokes negative emotions, while the texture is plastic, which proves the changes that are taking place and I refer to my painting.

A session referring to sadness, depression and loss of self. Colors, aesthetics, make-up,
The general climate underlines the mentioned emotions, the location is also not accidental.
The arrangement resembles a psychiatric hospital in disintegration. The main thought of the collection was also the phenomenon of madness,
mental illness. The black and red creation shows with its form exactly this phenomenon as from the arrangement (normal top and skirt cuts, everything starts
(distorted, the form spoils, deforms in a significant way, losing the old shapes). Male silhouette in which heavy thick
Pants juxtaposed with a transparent top shows the ""escape"" of self-esteem, losing and losing your own IAM.
The silhouette with the vest, on the other hand, shows the end of the sense of IAM, the form is simple, the clothes occupy a small part of the character, which indicates the remnants
personalities.

The session was intended to present my ideas and versions of fashion in the USSR during the Cold War.
The silhouettes are preserved in the climate of militarism heavy, spacious, but also preserved in a specific kitsch style.
and splendor. This is what I wanted to focus on the combination of pure usability and splendor. I was trying to get
luxury and specific kitsch without using small details or accessories, the assumption was to achieve the effect with the use of a form or
materials. Pink silhouette is the culmination of fun with form and the above mentioned idea.
